## Hi there, [Lorenz](your_github_link_here) here 👋🏼👨🏻💻

I am a dual student in Business Informatics, driven by a passion for technology 💻, particularly Pythonic programming 🐍 and Go. Beyond the screen, I'm deeply involved in photography 📸, videography 🎬, and the fascinating world of 3D printing and modeling 🖨️. My enthusiasm for open source 🐙 and hands-on projects shines through my work, including building my own NAS. I also enjoy tinkering with cars 🚗.

- 💬 Talk to me about the latest trends in tech, capturing the perfect shot, or optimising 3D prints.
- 👾 Fun fact: I've turned my passion for hardware into reality by building my own NAS and I'm always looking for new ways to customize and improve my car!
